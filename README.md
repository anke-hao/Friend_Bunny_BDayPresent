## Introduction


Welcome to the gamified interactive experience I made for my friend's birthday! In this experience, you play as a character in a 2D scene who navigates the environment to collect "care items," which are events or acts of friendship my friend and I experienced together, and bring them to the Tree of Friendship to make it grow.

The Friend Birthday Present Series is a series of short games I built, each over the course of 3-4 days, as birthday gifts for friends who were living in separate locations from me at the time of their birthday.

<br />

## How To Play
### Basic Commands
- Navigate with WASD. Once at a care item, dialogue will play automatically.
- Click to skip ahead in the dialogue or move to the next dialogue line.
  
### What to Expect
- The content of the game has been edited for privacy reasons, but the structure has remained the same! It is comprised of a single scene where you play as a bunny to pick up care items like watering pots or pickaxes and bring them (one at a time) to the Tree of Friendship at the center.
- After each care item is given to the tree, it will grow into the next stage. In its final stage, it will bear heart fruits and the ending dialogue will play.

### Level Design

- In line with the aesthetic preferences of my friend, the assets and environment reflect a cute, peaceful setting.
- The care items are:
  - Human Being & Citizen (a college class)
  - Essay Peer Editing
  - Summer 2021 Meetup
  - Friend Group Invites
  - Birthday Party Invite

## Tech Stack
The game was built in Unity2D, with the use of C# scripts for the following:
- managing the playable spriteâ€™s movements (PlayerController)
- handling dialogue, including skipping ahead or moving to the next dialogue line (Dialogue)
- handling the Tree of Friendship's growth stages (TreeGrowth)
- handling detection and carrying of care items by the player (TreeCare)
